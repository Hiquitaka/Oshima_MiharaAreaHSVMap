# Oshima_MiharaAreaHSVMap
This Processing program is making HSV relief map of Oshima island Mihara area from DEM.
First, you must download Processing, which URL is https://processing.org/download/ .
If your machine is Windows, you'll have a .zip file. Double-click it, and drag the folder inside to a location on your hard disk. It could be Program Files or simply the desktop, but the important thing is for the processing folder to be pulled out of that .zip file. Then double-click processing.exe to start.
Next, you have to copy and paste the program code, and open the oshimamihara_2m.txt.zip file.
After opening the 2m.txt file, you save the Processing (ファイル→名前を付けて保存) and put txt file into Processing file.
Finally, you push the play botton, and the program will be started.
